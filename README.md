## How it works

This extensions takes the "encrypted" paid Tailwind UI code:
```html
<div class="fy hs la vt cmz dls dmm dmx dpx dqf ebt">
    <div class="vu wt crd dpx">
        <div class="ff agg all ati ber bga bjg dlj dtp dvt"></div>
    </div>
</div>
```

And decrypts it to the original code:
```html
it does not work right now for some reason
```
